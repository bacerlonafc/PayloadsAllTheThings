#Wireless Hacking
Wireless Hacking will be more efficient if we know the attack flow of the target. In this project, the wireless hacking tools that will be using are Airgeddon and Evilgrade.

Airgeddon is written in bash and multi-use for Linux system to audit wireless networks and developed by V1s1t0rsh3r3. Evilgrade is a modular framework that allows the user to take advantage of poor upgrade implementations by injecting fake updates.

##Attacking Procedures
###1. Reconnaissance and Scanning
